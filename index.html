        <h3>An IoT-Based Occupation Detection System Utilizing Computer Vision and RFID Technology to Prevent Unauthorized Table Utilization</h3>

        <div class="section">
            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>“Neko Neko Nya,” a popular hobby shop in Kuching, Sarawak, serves as a vibrant community space for tabletop gaming
            and pop culture enthusiasts. Despite its success, the shop faces significant challenges during its scheduled board game events, 
            which are held at two large gaming tables. Unauthorized walk-ins frequently disrupt these events, leading to chaos and dissatisfaction 
            among players and management. This issue not only undermines the event's smooth operation but also affects the shop’s reputation within
            the local gaming community. There is a critical need for a reliable system that ensures only registered participants can access the 
            gaming tables while detecting and deterring unauthorized users. Such a system must provide real-time monitoring, secure access control, 
            and seamless table management to maintain the trust and satisfaction of the shop’s patrons.</p>

            <h4>Our Solution</h4>
            <p>
            To address the challenges faced by “Neko Neko Nya” during its board game events, a 
            smart integrated system leveraging IoT, RFID, and computer vision is proposed. This solution will 
            streamline table management, ensure authorized access, and enhance the overall gaming experience for 
            customers and management alike. A digital booking system will be developed, allowing users to register, 
            view available slots, and book tables in advance through a user-friendly web app. Booking records will be stored in a 
            Firebase database for real-time validation. To ensure secure table access, RFID technology will be implemented, enabling players 
            to scan their RFID cards at the tables to authenticate their bookings. This process will allow only authorized users to start a game.
            Overhead cameras equipped with ultrasonic sensors or computer vision running on ESP32 will monitor the occupancy of each table, ensuring the 
            presence of only authorized individuals. RGB LEDs installed along the table edges will visually indicate occupancy status, such as green for
             available and red for occupied. For room-wide monitoring, existing CCTV cameras will be integrated to track total occupancy, with the Raspberry
             Pi processing the video feeds to ensure alignment with the booking data. The system will also include a mechanism to detect unauthorized access
             at tables using the overhead cameras.
            If unregistered individuals are detected, real-time alerts will be sent to staff through the web app, allowing them to take prompt action.
            The Raspberry Pi will act as the central processing unit, managing data from the cameras, RFID system, and Firebase database. The Arduino Uno
            will handle RFID scanning and ultrasonic sensor inputs, communicating with the Raspberry Pi via MQTT for validation. Firebase will serve as the 
            backend to store user bookings, RFID access logs, and occupancy data, while the web app will provide users and staff with live updates on table
             availability and alerts for unauthorized access. This system offers a secure, efficient, and user-friendly solution to manage events, ensuring
             a smooth experience for all stakeholders while maintaining community trust.
